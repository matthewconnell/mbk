The 2014 CPS ASEC included redesigned questions for income and health insurance coverage. 
All of the approximately 98,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned set of 
health insurance coverage questions. The redesigned income questions were implemented to 
a subsample of these 98,000 addresses using a probability split panel design. Approximately 68,000 addresses 
were eligible to receive a set of income questions similar to those used in the 2013 CPS ASEC 
and the remaining 30,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned income questions. 
The source of the 2013 data for this table is the portion of the CPS ASEC sample which 
received the income questions consistent with the 2013 CPS ASEC, approximately 68,000 addresses.
